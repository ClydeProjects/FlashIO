2.3
===

- Create working directories if they do not exist.
- Add support for trimming all block from Intel SSDs.
- Add support for TRIM check of physical disk.
- Added check for benchmarking device 0. This prevents 
  overwriting the system disk.
- Fixed a bug where file pointer wrote outside LBA.

2.2
===

- Fix build with mingw 4.3.3.
- Use sector-aligned offsets for SetFilePointer() in RndFormat.
- Avoid an integer overflow in the offset calculation in RndFormat.
- Switch to SetFilePointerEx() instead of SetFilePointer() when seeking on
  devices.
- Fix some warnings when building.
- Correctly check buffering type in MicroBench.
- Returns BOOL instead of boolean when Windows returns BOOL in its API.
- Fix some possibly broken comparisons involving floats (use modulo instead).
- Fix several resources and memory leaks.
- Do not use sprintf with overlapping buffers (behavior undefined in the
  standard).
- Do not use FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN when opening devices, as the bench makes
  also random IOs.
- Fix a stack buffer overflow in GenBench when parsing the experiment plan.
- Correctly alloc/free sector-aligned data buffers.

Pre-2.2

- Unknown.
