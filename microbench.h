   	uFLIP was initially developed based on SQLIO2 by Leonard Chung although almost all SQLIO2 
   	code have disappeared. (leonard@ssl.berkeley.edu - see 
   	http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/siliconvalley/projects/sequentialio/ )
   	uFLIP also includes some lines from the pseudo random generator from Agner Fog
   	(see http://www.agner.org/random/)
